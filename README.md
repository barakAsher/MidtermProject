objects which give the user a better persective of the word in comparison to the players. The program also contains
funtionality for 3 different camera models one of which makes used of a frame in frame viewport. Specifically, the program 
has an arcBall camera, a free camera, and a viewport first person camera. Additionally, the program makes use of VAO's for
all objects and has custom shaders for the environment. Specifically the shaders implemented form a full Phong Reflectance 
model using Gouraud shading. The environment contains one directional light and one spotlight which showcase additive lighting
and attenuation and the lights are colored.
